			Hey there ðŸ‘‹. My name is Raf, and I'm the creator of Metal. Metal is born out of my experience as Co-founder and CTO at <a href="https://www.clever.com" target="_blank" class="link">Clever</a>. At Clever I spent most of my time building out our internal tools and infrastructure, enabling our relatively small engineering team to serve 10s of millions of students and teachers. I left Clever in 2023 and ever since have missed the tools that we built to deploy and monitor applications. Metal is my attempt to build those tools again, with a focus on simplicity and avoiding cloud lock-in.
